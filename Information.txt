                                                                Task Achieved

                                                                Problem faced

1-As I am not aware of flask i do not know how server will be connected to database.
2-I have read about memcached and LRU caching but due to unavailability of server i am not    able to implement it. 

3-initially when assignment was given to me i had no idea how to start and where to start    then i googled the things out and got to know that this is required from me.
4- i contacted my freinds also but they were also very new to this so they could not help me.
5-I have faced errors while setting up a virtual environment and get it resolved by changing some  execution policy of json settings.
6-I got winerror and oserror as well but get it resolved with the help of stack overflow.


                                                              Alternative way

1-It can be done with the help of javascrpit and node js.
2-API will be used there.
